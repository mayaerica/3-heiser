Ohter notes:
I found out I've been trying to do some impossible with the call assignment stuff by having each elevator constantly updating. We should aim for alternative one in the D-file readme which is much easier and has cookable code.

Note to self: Always read readme.

********************
Solved:


HandledBy is not removed by all elevators
- Another race condtition here. So same solution as up above. UpdateElevatorHallCallsAndButtonLamp, ResourceManager and  all have to wait for eachother.
- ^That solution should probably be changed with help of some channels.

Elevator freezes when called to its floor. Note that the program is still running, just the elevator and print freezes.
    - removed the mu lock here as it was uneccesary and cause the function wait here indefinetly, most likely because no one else used its variables or something.



********************
Unsolved:
Upon arriving on a floor the Direction goes "Up" "Down" "Stop" if it is set to stop at that floor
- ^ tried adding some mu.lock to fix this, Dont think it worked.

Done isnt removed and rather, a done on both button types is made
    -Not able to have this reoccur :/


Done is not removed if elevator is alone
- NOT IMPLEMENTED Fix: Upon being alone clear Handled_By

Remvoe done list. This is more of a todo.
 -  Just remove it from elevator and printing functions

For two elevators, when 2 commands are issued, both elevators do both in different orders.
 - NOT FIX: I have a suspition that hallcalls is wrongly used instead of requests somewhere
 - ^ or maybe it doesnt check if someone is already assigned or something

If you spam the floor the elevators at it'll stop MOVING

If an elevator is called to its own floor while communicating with other elevators it gets stuck.

Spamming current floor freezes elevator when alone

If an elevator is moving to a floor due to a hallcall, but another arrives before due to a cab call, the elevator going for the hallcall will go out of bounds.
 - ^This is because the cab call elevators steals the call. 
 -NOT IMPLEMENTED Fix: I think the best solution is to just make an elevator go to the nearest floor when its request is stolen


TODO for me:
- Make elevator set "Done" when arrived at floor
